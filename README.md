# CmdEngine: Lightweight Game Engine

## Tutorial is on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sadik_tutorials1).

CmdEngine is a really lightweight game engine at under 5 MB, It is built ontop of [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and C++. <br>
CmdEngine does not have a code editor but it uses c++ and its API to help making games, So you can use anything from Microsoft VS Code to Visual Studio or DevC++.<br>

Dependencies: 'raylib': `apt install libraylib-dev` or thru its github.<br>
Platforms:
  - WIndows (Through WSL on Windows 10 or later, Or thru virtualization on older versions)
  - LInux (Natively supported)
  - macOS (Not supported.)
